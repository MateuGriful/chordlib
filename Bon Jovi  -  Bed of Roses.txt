Bon Jovi - Bed of Roses

Bb                                            F
Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
       Bb                                         F
Trying hard to capture the moment, this morning I don't 
know
         Am                    Bb                      
Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head and 
 F
some blond
                                             B
Gave me nightmares, I think that she's still in my bed
     Bb                      C                         
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm 
F
dead
        Bb                                          F
With an ironclad fist I wake up to french kiss the morning
        Bb                                              
While some marching band keeps it's own beat in my head 
          F
while we're talking
      Am                  Bb                       F
About all of the things that I longed to believe, about 
love, the truth
                            Bb
And what you mean to me and the truth is
Bb          C        F        C
Baby you're all that I need

[Estribillo]

        Dm      C         Bb     F
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
    Dm        C          Bb     F
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
        Bb         F            Bb   F
I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
Dm  C   Bb                F
Lay you down, on a bed of roses

[Segunda Parte]

    Bb                                        F
Well I'm so far away, each step that I take's on my way 
home
Bb                                                      
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night just to see
         F
 through this payphone
    Am                           Bb                      
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through till 
    F
the bird on the wire
                       Bb
Flies me back to you. I'll just close my eyes
              Bb    Am       F         C
And whisper "baby blind love is true"

[Puente]

          Bb                  C
Well this hotel bars hangover whiskey's gone dry
       F
The barkeeps wig's crooked, and she's giving me the eye
Bb     C                        F     C
Well I might've said yeah, but I laughed so hard I think I died

(UHHH Yeah)

[Solo]


[Terceira Parte]

Bb                                                F
Now as you close your eyes, know I'll be thinking about 
you
      Bb                                                 
While my mistress she calls me to stand in her spotlight 
F
again, Tonight
Bb                                                F
I won't be alone, To know that don't mean I'm not lonely
         Dm          C               Bb                F   C
I've got nothing to prove, for it's you I'd die to defend
