Elton John - Rocket Man

[Primera Parte]

Em                                  A7
   She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Em                   A7  G/B
   Zero hour, nine a.m.
C                   G/B  Am   Am/G
  And I'm gonna be hi______gh
               D/F#
As a kite by then

Em                              A7
   I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Em                      A7  G/B
   It's lonely out in space
C            G/B  Am         Am/G  D/F#  D7
  On such a ti______meless flight

[Chorus]

G                                         C
  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                                         G
Till touchdown brings me round again to find
                                    C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
            G/B       A7
Oh no, no, no, I'm a Rocket Man
 C                                 G        C
Rocket Man, burning out a fuse up here alone

G                                         C
  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                                         G
Till touchdown brings me round again to find
                                    C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
            G/B       A7
Oh no, no, no, I'm a Rocket Man
 C                                 G        C
Rocket Man, burning out a fuse up here alone

[Segunda Parte]

Em                                  A7
   Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
Em                      A7  G/B
   In fact its cold as hell
C                      G/B     Am        Am/G
  And there's no one there to raise them
        D/F#
If you did

Em                                  A7
   And all this science, I don't understand
Em                            A7
   It's just my job 5 days a week
   G/B    C  G/B  Am    Am/G        D/F#
A Rocket ma__________an,    Rocket man

[Chorus]

G                                         C
  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                                         G
Till touchdown brings me round again to find
                                    C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
            G/B       A7
Oh no, no, no, I'm a Rocket Man
 C                                 G        C
Rocket Man, burning out a fuse up here alone

G                                         C
  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                                         G
Till touchdown brings me round again to find
                                    C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
            G/B       A7
Oh no, no, no, I'm a Rocket Man
 C                                 G        C
Rocket Man, burning out a fuse up here alone

                             G              C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                             G              C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                             G              C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                             G              C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                             G              C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                             G              C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
