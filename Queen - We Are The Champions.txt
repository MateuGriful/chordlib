Queen - We Are The Champions

[Primera Part]

              Cm  Gm7/C
I've paid my dues
            Cm  Gm7/C
Time after time
              Cm      Gm7/C
I've done my sentence
                   Cm  Gm7/C
But committed no crime
            Eb   Ab/Eb
And bad mistakes
             Eb  Ab/Eb
I've made a few
              Eb
I've had my share of sand
 Bb/D         Cm
Kicked in my face
    F            Bb
But I've come through
                  Bb7(4/9)
And we mean to go on
                  C
And on and on and on

 F           Am             Dm   Bb  C
We are the champions, my friends
     F             Am
And we'll keep on fighting
         Bb  F#°  Riff 1
Till the end
 Gm          G4(6)
We are the champions
 Bbm         E°      Riff 2
We are the champions
 F           Eb9/G
No time for losers
        Ab6         Bb
'Cause we are the champions
Cm7(11)         Fm   Gm7/F
        Of the world

[Segona Part]

               Cm  Gm7/C
I've taken my bows
                Cm   Gm7/C
And my curtain calls
                Cm
You brought me fame and fortune
                     Gm7/C
And everything that goes with it
            Cm  Gm7/C
I thank you all
                         Eb   Ab/Eb
But it's been no bed of roses
              Eb   Ab/Eb
No pleasure cruise
                  Eb
I consider it a challenge
             Bb/D       Cm
Before the whole human race
      F            Bb
And I ain't gonna lose
                  Bb7(4/9)
And we mean to go on
                  C
And on and on and on
