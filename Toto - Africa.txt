[Primera Part]
B                 D#m7       G#m
 I hear the drums echoing tonight
    B/F#             A/E            E/F#         E7M/G# A  G#m C#m
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversa______tion
B              D#m7      G#m      B/F#
 She's coming in 12:30 flight the moonlit wings
  A/E                  E/F#               E7M/G# A  G#m C#m
Reflect the stars that guide me toward salva_____tion
B              D#m7              G#m
 I stopped an old man along the way
B/F#                A/E            E/F#
Hoping to find some old forgotten words
           E7M/G# A  G#m C#m
Of ancient me___lodies
B              D#m7        G#m
 He turned to me as if to say

[Pre-Estribillo]
                  A                  G#m C#m
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you!"

[Estribillo]
F#m                   D               A        E
   It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
F#m                       D               A               E
   There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
F#m             D             A     E
   I bless the rains down in A__frica
F#m                      D             A
   It's gonna take some time to do the things
         C#m  E  F#m  E/G# A
We never had

[Segona Part]
B              D#m7            G#m
 The wild dogs cry out in the night
   B/F#               A/E              E/F#     E7M/G#  A  G#m C#m
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
B             D#m7             G#m
 I know that I must do what's right
        B/F#        A/E
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises
      E/F#             E7M/G#  A  G#m C#m
Like Olympus above the Serengeti
B           D#m7              G#m
 I seek to cure what's deep inside
                   A                    G#m C#m
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Estribillo]
F#m                   D               A        E
   It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
F#m                       D               A               E
   There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
F#m             D             A     E
   I bless the rains down in A__frica
F#m                      D             A
