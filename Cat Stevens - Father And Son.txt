[Primera Parte]

          G               D 
It's not time to make a change
        C              Am7
Just relax, take it easy
              G         
You're still young
             Em
That's your fault
            Am7               D
There's so much you have to know
        G            D  
Find a girl, settle down
        C             Am7
If you want, you can marry
         G       Em            Am7  D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm ha__ppy
      G                  D
I was once like you are now
        C                  Am7
And I know that's it's not easy
       G                Em    
To be calm when you've found
                Am7  D
Something going on
               G             D
But take your time, think a lot
         C                  Am7
Think of everything you've got
               G                 Em
For you will still be here tomorrow
           D         G  C/G  G  C/G
But your dreams may not

[Estribillo]

        G            Bm
How can I try to explain
        C            Am7
When I do he turns away again
     G                Em       
It's always been the same
           Am7  D
Same old story
          G              Bm   
From the moment I could talk
      C              Am7
I was ordered to listen
               G          Em   
Now there's a way and I know
        D       G
That I have to go away
    D     C       G  C/G  G  C/G
I know I have to go

[Segunda Parte]

          G               D
It's not time to make a change
          C              Am7
Just sit down, take it slowly
              G      
You're still young
             Em
That's your fault
            Am7        
There's so much
                  D
You have to go through
        G            D 
Find a girl, settle down
        C             Am7
If you want, you can marry
         G       Em      
Look at me, I am old
         Am7  D
But I'm ha__ppy

[Chorus 2]

         G                Bm
All the times that I've cried
        C                     Am7
Keeping all the things I knew inside
      G             Em     
It's hard but it's harder
      Am7    D
To ignore it
              G            Bm
If they were right, I'd agree
           C                 Am7
But it's them they know not me
               G          Em   
Now there's a way and I know
        D       G
That I have to go away
    D     C       G
I know I have to go
