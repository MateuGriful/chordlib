Queen - Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)

  Dm        Gm6/D   Dm
  When I'm gone no need to wonder
              Gm6/D
  if I ever think of you
       Dm         Gm6/D C#o/D
  the same moon shines
       Dm         Gm6/D  C#o/D  Gm6/D
  the same wind blows   for    both of us
                     Gm/D
  and time is but a paper moon
          Gm6/D   A7
  be not gone
    Dm        Gm6/D   Dm
  Though I'm gone   it's as though
                          Gm6/D
  I hold the flower that touches you
     Dm        Gm6/D C#o/D
  a new life grows
        Dm      Gm6/D C#o/D  Gm6/D
  the blossom knows there's no one else
                          Gm/D
  could warm my heart as much as you
          Gm6/D  A7
  be not gone
   D       G/D    D/F#  D      G/D    D
  Let us cling together as the years go by
  G      A7      D    A7/4
  oh my love my love
  A7      D
  In the quiet of the night
   A/C#    G/B           G
  let our candle always burn
          D/A            A7/4    A7      D       A7/4  A7
  let us never lose the lessons we have learned.

  Hear my song still think of me
                          Gm6/D
  the way you've come to think of me
       Dm          Gm6/D C#o/D
  the nights grow long
        Dm        Gm6/D  C#o/D        Gm6/D
  but dreams live on           just close your pretty eyes
               Gm/D
  and you can be with me
        Gm6/D   A7
  dream on
