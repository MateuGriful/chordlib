CHAIN OF FOOLS
Am

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out, love
I'm just a link in your chain, oh

You got me where you want me
I ain't nothing but your fool
You treated me mean
Oh, you treated me cruel

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools
Every chain
Has got a weak link
I might be weak, child
But I'll give you strength, oh, yeah

STOP MUSICA

You told me to leave you alone (Uh Uh)
My father said: Come on home
My doctor said: Take it easy
Oh, but your lovin' is much too strong
I'm added to your

IN MUSICA

Chain, chain, chain

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain-ain-ain-ain
(Chain, chain, chain)

Your chain of fools, oh
One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until then, yeah
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh, yeah

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain-ain-ain-ain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools, oh

Chain, chain, chain-ain-ain-ain-ain
(Chain, chain, chain) oh
Chain, chain, chain-ain-ain-ain-ain
Your chain of fools, oh, yeah
