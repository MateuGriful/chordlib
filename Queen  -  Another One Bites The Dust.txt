Queen - Another One Bites The Dust

[Intro]
[Riff 1]
Let´s go
Steve walks warily down
The street
With his brim pulled way
Down low 
Ain´t no sound but the sound of
His feet
Machine guns ready to go
          C              G
Are you ready, are you ready
For this
            C                       G
Are you hanging on the edge of you seat
C                               G
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
 A                         B   E
To the sound of the beat, yeah

(riff 1)
Another on bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one goes and
another one gone
Another one bites the dust

F#                     B   E  G  E  A
Another one bites the dust

 Em
How do you think I´m going to get alone
                          Am
Without you when you are gone
 Em
You took me for everything that I had
                        Am
And kicket me out on my own
         C                    G
Are you happy, are you sastisfied
     C                      G
How long can you stand the heat 
C                               G
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
 A                   B
To the sound of the beat

There are plenty of ways, 
You can hurt a man
                       Am
And bring him to the ground
              Em
You can beat him
You can cheat him bad and
You can treat him bad and

C                               G
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
