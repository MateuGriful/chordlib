Bruce Springsteen - The River

[Intro]
Em  G  D  C
        C/B  Am  G  C

   Em                  G             D                 C
I come from down in the valley, where mister when you're 
young
     Em              G  C              G
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
       C                                G           
Me and Mary we met in high school, when she was just 
D/F#    Em
seventeen
      Am                             G                    
We'd ride out of that valley down to where the fields were
 C
 green
         Em           C         D                   G   
We'd go down to the river, and into the river we'd dive
D/F#

    Em          C         D     C
Oh down to the river we'd ride
      Em           G           D                     C
Then I got Mary pregnant, and man that was all she wrote
        Em               G                    C         
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a 
         G
wedding coat
     C                                   G        D/F#   
We went down to the courthouse, and the judge put it all 
      Em
to rest
      Am                                            
No wedding day smiles no walk down in the aisle, no 
   G                 C
flowers no wedding dress
                    Em         C           D             
That night we went down to the river, and into the river 
      G
we'd dive
   Em            C           D    C
On down to the river we did ride

[Solo]
Em  G  D  C
       Em  G  C  G
       C  G  D/F#  Em
       Am  G  C

  Em                    G                   D           C
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
      Em                          G         C           
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the 
  G
economy
     C
Now all them things that seemed so important
              G                D/F#        Em
Well mister they vanished right into the air
            Am                              G            
Now I just act like I don't remember, Mary acts like she 
       C
don't care
        Em                      G
But I remember us riding in my brother's car
          D                      C
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
   Em                      G
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
             C                             G
And pull her close just to feel each other breath she'd 
take
          C                                      G  D/F#
Now those memories come back to haunt me, they haunt me 
       Em
like a curse
     Am                                    G              
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true, or is it something
      C
 worse that sends me
Em            C             D                G
Down to the river though I know the river is dry
     D/F#     Em          C     D      C
That sends me down to the river tonight
Em           C         D       G  D/F#  Em      C       
Down to the river, my baby and I, oh down the river we'd
   D   C
 ride
   Em    C    D   G  D/F#  Em  C  D  C
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
