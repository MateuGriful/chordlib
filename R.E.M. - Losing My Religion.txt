[Intro]
C  D  Em  Em/B
        C  D  Em  D9

[Primera Part]

     Em
Oh, life is bigger
Bm
   It's bigger than you
             Em
And you are not me
                         Bm
The lengths that I will go to
                       Em
The distance in your eyes
Bm                       Am
   Oh no, I've said too much
         D9
I set it up

                  Em
That's me in the corner
                   Bm
That's me in the spotlight
             Em
Losing my religion
           Bm
Trying to keep up with you
       Em
And I don't know if I can do it
Bm                       Am
   Oh no, I've said too much
                 D9
I haven't said enough

[Estribillo]

                            C
I thought that I heard you laughing
                  D         Em   Em/B
I thought that I heard you sing
    C                    D    Em  D9
I think I thought I saw you try

[Primera Part]

           Em
Every whisper
                 Bm
Of every waking hour
                    Em
I'm choosing my confessions
           Bm
Trying to keep an eye on you

        Em
Like a hurt, lost and 

Blinded fool, fool
Bm                       Am
   Oh no, I've said too much
         D9
I set it up

           Em
Consider this, consider this
     Bm
The hint of the century
           Em
Consider this
                Bm
The slip that brought me

To my knees failed
 Em
What if all these fantasies
     Bm
Come    flailing around
          Am       D9
Now I've said too much

[Estribillo]

                            C
I thought that I heard you laughing
                  D         Em  Em/B
I thought that I heard you sing
    C                    D    Em  D9
I think I thought I saw you try

      G               A9
But that was just a dream
  G               A9
That was just a dream

[Primera Part]

                  Em
That's me in the corner
                   Bm
That's me in the spotlight
             Em
Losing my religion
           Bm
Trying to keep up with you
       Em
And I don't know if I can do it
Bm                       Am
   Oh no, I've said too much
                 D9
I haven't said enough

[Estribillo Final]

      C                   D
But that was just a dream
  Em               Em/B
Try, cry, why, try
  C
That was just a dream
 D       Em            D9         Em/B
Just a dream, just a dream, dream
