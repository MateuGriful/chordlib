Bruce Springsteen - Thunder Road

Intro:  F  Dm  F  Bb  F  Am  Bb  C

    F                Bb       F
The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
                         C                       Bb
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio 
plays
                             C
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
           F                  Bb
Hey that's me and I want you only
                            F                 C
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone 
again
       F                       Bb                     F
Don't run back inside, darling you know just what I'm here
 for
So you're scared and you're thinking
     C                    Bb
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
                                          C
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
            F                        Bb
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright
       F                 C
Oh and it's alright with me
        F                          Dm
You can hide neath your covers and study your pain
     F                               Bb
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
 F                 Am
Waste your summer praying in vain
       Bb                         C
For a saviour to rise from these streets
             F                     Dm
Well now I'm no hero, that's understood
         F                                Bb
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this 
dirty hood
        F                Am
With a chance to make it good somehow
     Bb                 C
Hey what else can we do now?
        F                       Bb                F    
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back 
         Bb F
your hair
Well the night's busting open
      Am                     Bb
These two lanes will take us anywhere
                                  C
We got one last chance to make it real
    F                            Bb
To trade in these wings on some wheels
              F                     C
Climb in back heaven's waiting down on the tracks
  F         Dm
Oh oh come take my hand
       F                     Bb
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
F        Am               Bb               C
Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder 
Road,
F                      Dm
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
    F                   Bb
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run
F        Am                   Bb         C           
Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold, Thunder 
  F
Road
F    Am Bb                    C                      F
Well I  got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
       Dm                                          Bb   
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long 
C
walk
          Bb                      C
From your front porch to my front seat
           Am                         Dm
The door's open but the ride it ain't free
    Bb            Bb/A                  Gm      F
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
      C              Bb            Am             Gm
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
           F                     Bb               F    
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent 
    Bb F
away
They haunt this dusty beach road
       Am                 Bb
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
                                      C
They scream your name at night in the street
                 F                         Bb
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet and in the
Am                                     Bb
Lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on 
but when you
Gm                       C           Bb                 Gm
Get to the porch they're gone on the wind so Mary climb in
       Bb                          C                      
It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to 
F
win

OUTRO:  F  C  F  Bb  F  C  Bb  C

Gm....until fade
