[Primera Parte]

  D
She's got a smile

That it seems to me
   C
Reminds me of childhood memories
      G
Where everything was as fresh
                     D
As the bright blue sky

 D
Now and then

When I see her face
     C
She takes me away to that special place
           G
And if I stare too long
                              D
I'd probably break down and cry

[Estribillo]

A     C                   D
Oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
A        C                  D
Oh oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

[Solo 1] D  C  G  D

[Segunda Parte]

  D
She's got eyes

Of the bluest skies
   C
As if they thought of rain
   G
I hate to look into those eyes
     D
And see an ounce of pain

     D
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
      C
Where as a child I'd hide
      G
And pray for the thunder

And the rain
     D
To quietly pass me by

[Estribillo]

A     C                   D
Oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
A        C                  D
Oh oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

Oh oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
A        C                  D
Uh uh uh uh, sweet love of mine
