Elton John - Sorry seems to be the hardest word

Gm                        Bb       Cm7
What have I got to do to make you love me?
F                                   Bb  Am5-  D7
 What have I got to do to make you care?
Gm                      Bb/F           Cm7
  What do I  do when lightning strikes me?
F                                       Bb  Am5-  D7
  And I wake to find that you´re  not there?

Gm               Bb            Cm7
What do I do to make you want me?
F                                Bb  Am5-  D7
 What have I gotta do to be heard?
Gm                              Cm7
  What do I say when it’s all over?
     F                             Bb  F
And sorry seems to be the hardest word?

Eb/G       D/F#       Bb/F                 Em7(5-)
It’s sad,      so sad      It’s a sad sad situation
Cm/Eb                  D7               Gm  Am7(5-)  D7
     And it’s getting more and more absurd
Eb/G          D/F#       Bb/F                  C7/E
    It’s sad,     so sad     Why can’t we talk it over?
Eb
  Oh, it seems to me
 Cm7             D7            Gm    Cm
Sorry seems to be the hardest word?
