Keane - Everybody's Changing

[Intro]

[Piano] 

C                        F
You say you wander your own land
     Dm
But when I think about it
   G                    C   C7+  C9  C7+  C
I don't see how you can

        C
You're aching, you're breaking
    F
And I can see the pain in your eyes
      Dm
Says everybody's changing
    G               C   C7+    C9   C7+
And I don't know why

[Estribillo] 
F           G
So little time
C                       F
Try to understand that I'm
Dm                             G
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
   Em7                     A
I try to stay awake and remember my name
      Dm                        G                C   C7+  C9  C7+ C
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

C
You're gone from here
Soon you will disappear
   F
Fading into beautiful light
  Dm
'cos everybody's changing
G                    C   C7+  C9  C7+ 
And I don't feel right

[Estribillo] 
F           G
So little time
C                       F
Try to understand that I'm
Dm                             G
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
   Em7                     A
I try to stay awake and remember my name
      Dm                        G                C   C7+  C9  C7+ C
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same
