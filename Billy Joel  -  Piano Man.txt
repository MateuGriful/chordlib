It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
        F   C/E         D7  G
The regular crowd shuffles in
            C        G/B    Am      Am/G
There's an old man  sitting next to me
       F           G11       C     G/B
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
         C          G/B       Am    Am/G
He says Son can you play me a memory
    F          C/E         D7     G
I'm not really sure how it goes
         C            G/B         Am        Am/G
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
     F        G11            C
When I wore a younger man's clothes"

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C/E     D7     G
Sing us a song to night
           C           G/B       Am    Am/G
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
           F       G           C
And you've got us feeling all right

     C          G/B       Am          Am/G
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
   F          C/E        D7     G
He gets me my drinks for free
         C            G/B        Am            Am/G
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
            F               G11         C     G/B
But there's some place that he'd rather be
         C        G/B            Am       Am/G
He says "Bill I believe this is killing me"
     F         C/E          D7       G
As a smile ran away from his face
          C           G/B         Am     Am/G
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
   F           G11         C
If I could get out of this place"

    C         G/B          Am      Am/G
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
    F          C/E       D7      G
Who never had time for a wife
         C            G/B          Am           Am/G
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
    F        G11         C      G/B
And probably will be for life
        C           G/B         Am     Am/G
And the waitress is practicing politics
       F           C/E       D7      G
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
            C         G/B               Am    Am/G
Yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
         F           G11       C
But it's better than drinking alone

[Quarta Parte]
C         G/B             Am        Am/G
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C/E     D7     G
Sing us a song to night
           C           G/B       Am    Am/G

       C           G/B         Am       Am/G
It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
        F       C/E        D7      G
And the manager gives me a smile
          C               G/B                  Am        
`Cause he knows that it's me that they've been coming to 
Am/G
see
      F         G11        C      G/B
To forget about life for a while

        C     G/B           Am      Am/G
And the piano sounds like a carnival
        F          C/E           D7    G
And the microphone smells like a beer
         C          G/B          Am          Am/G
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
         F            G11       C
And say "Man what are you doing here ?
