Elton John - Can You Feel The Love Tonight

[Intro]
Bb  F/A  Eb/G  Bb/F  Eb  Bb/D
        F/A  Bb  C4  Bb/D

[Primera Part]
  Eb               Bb/D
There's a calm surrender
 Eb             Bb/D
To the rush of day
  Eb                  Bb/D
When the heat of the rolling wind
 Cm7            F
Can be turned away
Eb            Bb/D
An enchanted moment
Eb                Bb/D
And it sees me through
Eb                    Gm
It's enough for this restless warrior
 Ab              F
Just to be with you

[Chorus]
     Bb      F/A      Gm     Eb
And can you feel the love tonight?
Bb         Eb   C/E  F
   It is where we    are
Eb        Bb/D           Gm  Bb/F  Eb
   It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
 Cm   Bb/D  Eb   C/E  F
That we    got this  far

     Bb      F/A      Gm     Eb
And can you feel the love tonight?
Bb           Eb   C/E  F
   How it's laid to   rest?
Eb        Bb/D          Gm   Bb/F  Eb
   It's enough to make kings and  vagabonds
   Cm    Bb/D  Eb  F  Bb4  Bb
Believe the   ve__ry best

( F/A  Eb/G  Bb/F  Eb  Bb/D )
( F/A  Bb  C4  Bb/D )

[Segona Part]
  Eb               Bb/D
There's a time for everyone
Eb            Bb/D
If they only learn
  Eb                 Bb/D
That the twisting kaleidoscope
 Cm7             F
Moves us all in turn
  Eb                 Bb/D
There's a rhyme and reason
 Eb             Bb/D
To the wild outdoors
  Eb                    Gm
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
 Ab                 F
Beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
     Bb      F/A      Gm     Eb
And can you feel the love tonight?
Bb         Eb   C/E  F
   It is where we    are
Eb        Bb/D           Gm  Bb/F  Eb
   It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
 Cm   Bb/D  Eb   C/E  F
That we    got this  far

     Bb      F/A      Gm     Eb
And can you feel the love tonight?
Bb           Eb   C/E  F
   How it's laid to   rest?
Eb        Bb/D          Gm   Bb/F  Eb
   It's enough to make kings and  vagabonds
   Cm    Bb/D  Eb  F  Bb4  Bb
Believe the   ve__ry best

Eb        Bb/D          Gm   Bb/F  Eb
   It's enough to make kings and  vagabonds
   Cm    Bb/D  Eb  F  Bb4  Bb
Believe the   ve__ry best
