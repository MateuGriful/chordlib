[Intro]
F  Bb  C  Bb  F  C

                   F
Well it's Saturday night
                   Bb     C
You're all dressed up in blue
                             Bb
I've been watching you for a while
                 F          C
Maybe you been watching me too
                F
So somebody ran out
                 Bb         C
Left somebody's heart in a mess
                           Bb
Well if you're looking for love
       F          C         F
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls they want a handsome Dan
         Bb           C
Or some good-lookin' Joe
                    Bb                       F   C
On their arm some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo
                 F
Well 'round here baby
               Bb              C
I learned you get what you can get
                              Bb
So if you're rough enough for love
       F          C         F
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

                  Dm      Bb
Yeah the road is dark
                    F
And it's a thin thin line
                  Bb                           C   F
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
                   Dm      Bb
Maybe your other boyfriends
                   F
Couldn't pass the test
                                   Bb
Well if you're rough and ready for love
        F          C        F
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

SOLO : as verse chords

F
Well it ain't no secret
                    Bb       C
I've been around a time or two
                  Bb                F           C
Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too
                     F
Well there's another dance
              Bb         C
All you gotta do is say yes
                                  Bb
And if you're rough and ready for love
       F            C       F
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
                           Bb
If you're rough enough for love
      F           C        F
Baby I'm tougher than the rest
