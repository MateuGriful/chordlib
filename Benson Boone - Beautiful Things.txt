Benson Boone - Beautiful Things

[Intro]
D  A  E

[Primera Part]

        D                 A
For a while there it was rough
            E                F#m
But lately, I've been doin' better
          D                A    
Than the last four cold Decembers 
         E
I recall
              D            A
And I see my family every month
           E               F#m
I found a girl my parents love
                  D                   
She'll come and stay the night and I
  A                       E
Think I might have it all

        D              A
And I thank God every day
         E       Fº      F#m
For the girl he sent my way
        D                 A      
But I know the things he gives me
                 E
He can take away
       D              A
And I hold you every night
              F#m     
And that's a feeling 
   E        D
I wanna get used to
                Bm                      
But there's no man as terrified 
        E                          
As the man who stands to lose you

[Pre-Estribillo]

D  A                     E      
     Oh, I hope I don't lose you 
F#m     D        A       E
    Mm,   please    stay
   F#m                      D
I want you, I need you, oh God
      A       E
Don't    take
                                  D
These beautiful things that I've got

[Estribillo]

       A      F#m
Please    stay
   E                        D
I want you, I need you, oh God
      A       F#m
Don't    take
       E                          D
Thеse beautiful things that I've got
         A       F#m  E     D
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh,  oh-oh-oh
       A         E
Please    don't take

[Segona Part]

            D                 A
I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
              E    
It's been a while
                    F#m
But I'm finding my faith
                 D                 
If everything's good and it's great
       A                         E
Why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?

Oh, I'll tell ya 
    D             A
I know I've got enough
          E        Fº        F#m
I've got peace and I've got love
        D                  
But I'm up at night thinkin'
A                    E
I just might lose it all

[Estribillo Final]

D          A      F#m
   Please    stay
   E                        D
I want you, I need you, oh God
      A       F#m
Don't    take
       E                          D
Thеse beautiful things that I've got
         A       F#m  E     D
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh,  oh-oh-oh

D        A       E
  Please    stay
                            D
I want you, I need you, oh God
  A       E
I    need

These beautiful things that I've got
