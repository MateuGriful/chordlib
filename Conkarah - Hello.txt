Hello - Conkarah
[Intro]
Fm Ab  Eb Db (x1)
 
[Verse 1]
  Fm  Ab  	Eb  Db
Hello, it's me
   Fm       	Ab          	Eb           	Db
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
  Fm  Ab   	Eb  Db
To go over everything
        	Fm            	Ab
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
       	Eb    	      Db
But I ain't done much healing

[Verse 2] (Anacrusa BATERIA)
Fm  Ab   	Eb  	Db
Hello, can you hear me?
 Fm       	Ab             	Eb   	Db
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
      	Fm 	Ab  	Eb  Db
When we were younger and free
 Fm        Ab         	Eb            	Db
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
 	Fm    	Eb                   Cm   Db
There's such a difference between us
   Fm	Eb	Db
And a million miles
 
[Chorus]
Fm     	Db  	Ab        Eb
Hello from the other side
Fm           	Db      	Ab  Eb
I must've called a thousand times
   	Fm  	Db
To tell you I'm sorry
     	Ab            	Eb
For everything that I've done
     	Fm  	Db
But when I call you never
Ab       	Eb
Seem to be home

Fm         	Db	Ab Eb
Hello from the outside
   Fm          	Db        	Ab Eb
At least I can say that I've tried
   	Fm  	Db
To tell you I'm sorry
	Ab           	Eb
For breaking your heart
        	
      Fm      	Db
But it don't matter, it clearly
    	Ab       	Eb	 
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Fm Ab  Eb Db (x1)

[Verse 3] (Anacrusa BATERIA)
  Fm  Ab      	Eb Db
Hello, how are you?
	Fm      	Ab      	Eb          	Db
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
  Fm  Ab         	Eb Db  	 
I hope that you're well
 Fm       	Ab
  Did you ever make it out of that town
  	Eb       	Db
Where nothing ever happened?
    	Fm   Eb
It's no secret
     	Cm  	Db
That the both of us
	Fm    	Eb  	Db
Are running out of time
 
[Chorus]
Fm         	Db  	Ab Eb
Hello from the other side (other side)
  Fm           	Db      	Ab       	Eb
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
      	Fm  	Db
To tell you I'm sorry
     	Ab            	Eb
For everything that I've done
          	Fm  	Db
But when I call you never
Ab       	Eb
Seem to be home

Fm         	Db	Ab Eb
Hello from the outside
   Fm          	Db        	Ab Eb
At least I can say that I've tried
   	Fm  	Db
To tell you I'm sorry
	Ab           	Eb
For breaking your heart
      Fm      	Db
But it don't matter, it clearly
    	Ab       	Eb	 
Doesn't tear you apart anymore
