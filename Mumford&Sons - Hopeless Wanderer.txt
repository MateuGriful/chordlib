Mumford & Sons - Hopeless Wanderer

A#        F/A   Cm
You heard my voice
        Gm        F        D#
I came out of the woods by choice
A#            F/A       Cm
Shelter also gave their shade
           Gm      F     A#
But in the dark I have no name

A#             F/A         Cm
So leave that click in my head
           Gm           F            D#
And I will remember the words that you said
A#                       F/A   Cm
Left a clouded mind and heavy heart
         Gm            F        D#
But I am sure we could see a new start

Gm  F              A#       D#
      So when your hopes on fire
Gm  F              A#      D#
      But you know your desire
            Gm                F
Don't hold a glass over the flame
               A#         D#
Don't let your heart grow cold
      Gm         F
I will call you by name
       A#           D#
I will share your road

( Gm )

Gm           Gm
Hold me fast, Hold me fast
            D#   Gm    F   Gm
Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
Gm           Gm
Hold me fast, Hold me fast
            D#   Gm    F   A#
Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer

(A#- F/A - Cm - Gm - F - D#)

A#              F/A     Cm
I wrestled long with my youth
            Gm        F       D#
We tried so hard to live in the truth
A#                F/A    Cm
But do not tell me all is fine
                Gm       F       A#
When I lose my head, I lose my spine

A#                  F/A   Cm
So leave that click in my head
            Gm        F             D#
And I won't remember the words that you said
A#                 F/A      Cm
You brought me out from the cold
     Gm               F          D#
Now How I long, how I long to grow old

Gm  F              A#       D#
      So when your hopes on fire
Gm  F              A#      D#
      But you know your desire
            Gm                F
Don't hold a glass over the flame
               A#         D#
Don't let your heart grow cold
      Gm         F
I will call you by name
       A#           D#
I will share your road

Hold me fast, Hold me fast

Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
Gm             Gm                      D#  A#  F   Gm
I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
