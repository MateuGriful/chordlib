[Intro]
Dm  Bb  F  C
Dm  Bb  F  C

[Primera Part]

Dm          Bb               F           C
   Do you know what's worth fighting for
Dm            Bb        F         C
   When it's not worth dying for?
Dm          Bb         F         C
   Does it take your breath away
         Bb                 C
And you feel yourself suffocating?

Dm           Bb         F         C
   Does the pain weight out the pride?
Dm          Bb          F       C
   And you look for a place to hide?
Dm         Bb              F       C
   Did someone break your heart inside?
           Bb   C5
You're in ruins

[Chorus 1]

F5     E5+       D5
One, twenty one guns
 C5           Bb5
Lay down your arms
 F5          C5
Give up the fight
F5     E5+       D5
One, twenty one guns
   C5         Bb5  F5           C5
Throw up your arms into the sky
        Bb5  F5  C5
You and I

[Segona Part]
Dm             Bb     F           C
   When you're at the end of the road
Dm          Bb       F               C
   And you lost all sense of control
Dm            Bb           F               C
   And your thoughts have taken their toll
           Bb                             C
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Dm       Bb              F      C
   Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm          Bb       F       C
   And the hangover doesn't pass
Dm           Bb     F       C
   Nothing's ever built to last
           Bb   C5
You're in ruins

[Chorus 2]

F5     E5+       D5
One, twenty one guns
 C5           Bb5
Lay down your arms
 F5          C5
Give up the fight
F5     E5+       D5
One, twenty one guns
   C5         Bb5  F5           C5
Throw up your arms into the sky
        Bb5  F5  C5
You and I

[Tercera Part]
D5           Bb5   F5          C5
   Did you try to live on your own
D5           Bb5             F5        A5
   When you burned down the house and home?
D5          Bb5        F5          A5
   Did you stand too close to the fire?
        Bb5
Like a liar looking for
    C5
Forgiveness from a stone

[Solo]

[Riff 1]
Dm  Bb  F  C

[Quarta Parte]

Dm            Bb      F            C
   When it's time to live and let die
Dm          Bb         F         C
   And you can't get another try

Dm           Bb           F         C
   Something inside this heart has died
           Bb
You're in ruins

Throw up your arms into the sky

One, twenty one guns
 C5           Bb5
Lay down your arms
 F5          C5
Give up the fight
F5     E5+       D5
One, twenty one guns
