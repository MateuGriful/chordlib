Muse - Hysteria

[Intro]
(Riff 1)

(Riff 2)

      Am
It's bugging me
  E
Grating me
      Dm          Am
And twisting me around
         Am
Yeah I'm endlessly
 E
Caving in
     Dm            Am
And turning inside out

( A5 )

[Estribillo]
                  C5
'Cause I want it now
           G5
I want it now
D5                            A5
 Give me your heart and your soul
                 C5
And I'm breaking out
             G5
I'm breaking out
D5                        E5
 Last chance to lose control

(Riff 2)

[Segona Part]

           Am
Yeah It's holding me
 E
Morphing me
     Dm              Am
And forcing me to strive
      Am
To be endlessly
 E
Cool within
      Dm           A5
And dreaming I'm alive

[Estribillo]

                  C5
'Cause I want it now
           G5
I want it now
D5                            A5
 Give me your heart and your soul
                 C5
And I'm breaking out
             G5
I'm breaking out
D5                        A5
 Last chance to lose control
