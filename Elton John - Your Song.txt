Elton John - Your Song

[Intro]
 C  F/C  G/C  F/C

[Primera Part]

C                    F7M
  It's a little bit funny
G/B                 Em7
     This feeling inside
Am                  Am/G
   I'm not one of those who can
Am/F#         F7M
      Easily hide
C/G                    G
    I don't have much money
    E/G#            Am
But       boy if I did
C                Dm7
  I'd buy a big house where
F                G   G4  G
  We both could live

C              F7M
  If I was a sculptor
G/B                  Em7
    But then again, no
      Am            Am/G
Or a man who makes potions in a
Am/F#              F7M
      Travelling show
C/G                  G
    I know it's not much
              E/G#       Am
But it's the best I can do
C                Dm7
  My gift is my song
    F                 C  F/C  C
And   this one's for you

[Chorus]

G/B                  Am
    And you can tell everybody
Dm               F
   This is your song
G/B             Am
    It may be quite simple but
Dm                F
   Now that it's done
Am
   I hope you don't mind
Am/G
     I hope you don't mind
Am/F#                     Dm/F
      That I put down in words
     C/E      Dm7
How wonderful life is
       F             G    G4  G
While you're in the world

C  F/C  G/C  F/C

[Segona Part]

C               F7M
  I sat on the roof
G/B                     Em7
    And kicked off the moss
       Am         Am/G
But a few of the verses
                   Am/F#     F7M
Well, they've got me quite cross
C/G                      G
    But the sun's been quite kind
E7/G#                    Am
      While I wrote this song
C                       Dm7
  It's for people like you that
F          G        G4  G
  Keep it turned on

C                  F7M
  So excuse me forgetting
G/B                  Em7
    But these things I do
Am                  Am/G
   You see I've forgotten
             Am/F#            F7M
If they're green or they're blue
C/G                 G
   Anyway the thing is
        E7/G#      Am
What I really mean
C                 Dm7
  Yours are the sweetest eyes
F            C   F/C  C
  I've ever seen

[Chorus]

G/B                  Am
    And you can tell everybody
Dm               F
   This is your song
G/B             Am
    It may be quite simple but
Dm                F
   Now that it's done
Am
   I hope you don't mind
Am/G
     I hope you don't mind
Am/F#                     Dm/F
      That I put down in words
     C/E      Dm7
How wonderful life is
       F             G    G4  G
While you're in the world

Am
   I hope you don't mind
Am/G
     I hope you don't mind
Am/F#                     Dm/F
      That I put down in words
     C/E       Dm7
How wonderful life is
       F             C
While you're in the world

[Final] F/C  G/C  F/C  C
