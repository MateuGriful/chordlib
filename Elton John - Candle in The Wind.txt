Elton John - Candle in The Wind

   E                               A
Goodbye Norma Jean, Though I never knew you at all
                           E/G#                        
You had the grace to hold yourself, While those around 
           A
you crawled
                           E                        A
They crawled out of the woodwork, And they whispered 
into your brain
                        E/G#                           
They set you on the treadmill, And they made you change
       A
 your name

        B                           B7         E       
"And it seems to me you lived your life, Like a candle 
      A
in the wind
       E                                B
Never knowing who to cling to, When the rain set in
             A                                C#m
And I would have liked to have known you, But I was 
just a kid
                         B                A
Your candle burned out long before, your legend ever 
will

( A  E/G#  F#m  E  B7  A  E/G#  F#m  E  B7  )

    E                                    A
Loneliness was tough, The toughest role you ever played
                         E                            
Hollywood created a superstar, And pain was the price 
A
you paid
                 E          A
Even when you died, Oh the press still hounded you
             \        E                                 
All the papers had to say, Was that Marilyn was found 
      A
in the nude

        B                           B7         E       
"And it seems to me you lived your life, Like a candle 
      A
in the wind
       E                                B
Never knowing who to cling to, When the rain set in
             A                                C#m
And I would have liked to have known you, But I was 
just a kid
                         B                A
Your candle burned out long before, your legend ever 
did

( A  E/G#  F#m  E )

   E                               A
Goodbye Norma Jean, Though I never knew you at all
                           E/G#                        
You had the grace to hold yourself, While those around 
           A
you crawled
     E                                    A
Goodbye Norma Jean, From the young man in the 22nd row
                               E                    
Who sees you as something as more than sexual, More 
                      A
than just our Marilyn Monroe

Chorus
        B                           B7         E       
"And it seems to me you lived your life, Like a candle 
      A
in the wind
       E                                B
Never knowing who to cling to, When the rain set in
             A                                C#m
And I would have liked to have known you, But I was 
just a kid
                         B                A
Your candle burned out long before, your legend ever 
did

( A  E/G#  F#m  E )

                       B                  A
Your candle burned out long before, Your legend ever 
did
