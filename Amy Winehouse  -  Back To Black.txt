Amy Winehouse - Back To Black

[intro] 
Dm  Gm  Bb  A7
[primera Parte]
Dm                 	Gm
   He left no time to regret
Bb
Kept his  dick wet
                   	A7
With his same old safe	bet

 Dm    	Gm
Me and my head high
    	Bb
And my tears dry
            	A7
Get on without my guy

 Dm                   	Gm
You went back to what you know
	Bb
So far removed
                  	A7
From all that we went through

	Dm          	Gm
And I tread a troubled track
    	Bb
My odds are stacked
         	A7
I'll go back	to black

[Estribillo]
Dm                        	Gm
We only said goodbye with words

I died a hundred times
Bb
You go back to her
	A7
And I go back to

STOP MUSICA, NOMES BATERIA
         	
                Dm
I go back to us

[Segona Part]
        	Gm
I love you much
       	Bb
It's not enough
              	A7
You love blow and I love puff
 	Dm  	Gm
And life is like a pipe
            	
                   Bb               	A7
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

[Estribillo]
Dm                        	Gm
   We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
Bb
   You go back to her
	A7
And I go back to
Dm                        	Gm
   We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
Bb
   You go back to her
	A7
And I go back to

STOP MUSICA

[Tercera Part]
Dm   	Bb7M
   Black, 	black
F   	A7
  Black,   black
Dm   	Bb7M
   Black, 	black
F
  Black
A7
   I go back to

I go back to

[Estribillo] x2
