Muse - Undisclosed Desires

Intro 2x: Am Em 

Riff: (Quando o vocalista começa a cantar)

 C
 I know you've suffered
       Em
 But I don't want you to hide
 C
 It's cold and loveless
         Em
 I won't let you be denied

 C
 Soothing
      Em
 I'll make you feel pure
 C
 Trust me
 Em
 You can be sure

(Refrão)

Riff refrão:

Am         C             Em               G
 I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Am         C              Em                  G
 I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
Am         C            Em               G
 I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Am         C           Em            G             C
 I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

 You trick your lovers
             Em
 That you're wicked and divine
 C
 You may be a sinner
          Em
 But your innocence is mine
 C
 Please me
 Em
 Show me how it's done
 C
 Tease me
 Em
 You are the one

(Refrão)

 I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
Am         C            Em               G
 I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Am         C           Em            G             C
 I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

Am         C             Em               G
