[Primera Part]
C                           D/F#
  So, so you think you can tell
             Am/E                  G  
Heaven from hell, blue skies from pain
                      D/F#
Can you tell a green field
                   C    
From a cold steel rail
                Am/E 
A smile from a veil?  
                      G
Do you think you can tell?
                      C   
Did they get you to trade 
                  D/F#     
Your heroes for ghosts
                Am/E
Hot ashes for trees
               G          
Hot air for a cool breeze
                   D/F#    
Cold comfort for change?  
            C
Did you exchange
                       Am/E
A walk on part in the war
                      G
For a lead role in a cage?

[Estribillo]
C
  How I wish
                       D/F#
How I wish you were here 
             Am/E         
We're just two lost souls

Swimming in a fish bowl 
G                 
  Year after year
D/F#                                    
     Running over the same old ground
C                     
  What have we found?
                Am/E
The same old fears 
               G
Wish you were here
