    F#m       C#m
When i met you
       B            A
I was just a child
             F#m       C#m
Working through
 B            A
Fears of the night
         F#m       C#m
Then you flew
 B          A
Over to my side
           F#m       C#m
And then i knew
        B           A
It had always been right

F#m
To give    
C#m
To love    
B
To stay
    G#m
In touch
    A
To give
    C#m
Enough
    B     A
To love

                F#m
Till it lasts forever
                  C#m
Till it lasts so long
                   B
Till we’re back together
          A
I’ll be alone

                F#m
Till it lasts forever
                  C#m
Till it lasts so long
                   B
Till we’re back together

I’ll be alone

( F#m  C#m  B  A )

        F#m         C#m
Now i’m leaving you
        B           A
For the both of us
        F#m          C#m
To find something new
           B           A
Cause were not enough
        F#m         C#m
And all i can do
        B           A
Is to know

    F#m
That we
    C#m
Could meet
     B
Again
    G#m
Sometime
    A
When we
    C#m
Could be
    B     A
The end

                F#m
Till it lasts forever
                  C#m
Till it lasts so long
                   B
Till we’re back together
          A
I’ll be alone

                F#m
Till it lasts forever
                  C#m
Till it lasts so long
                   B
Till we’re back together
          A
I’ll be alone

                F#m
Till it lasts forever
                  C#m
Till it lasts so long
                   B
Till we’re back together
          A
I’ll be alone

                F#m
Till it lasts forever
                  C#m
Till it lasts so long
                   B
Till we’re back together
          A
I’ll be alone
