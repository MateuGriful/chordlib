[Intro]

[Primera Part]

 C    Em  Am 
Wise men say
       F    C   G
Only fools rush in
    F  G     Am  
But I can't help

Falling in love with you

[Segona Part]

  C   Em  Am  
Shall I stay?

Falling in love with you

[Estribillo]

Em           B7        
   Like a river flows
Em             B7
   Surely to the sea
Em             B7       
   Darling, so it goes
       A7                 Dm  G7
Some things are meant to be

[Tercera Part]

 C    Em  Am 
Take my  hand
          F     C    G
Take my whole life too
       F  G     Am   
'Cause I can't help
 F          C    G    C
Falling in love with you

[Estribillo]

Em           B7        
   Like a river flows
Em             B7
   Surely to the sea
Em             B7       
   Darling, so it goes
       A7                 Dm  G7
Some things are meant to be

[Tercera Part]

 C    Em  Am 
Take my  hand

Take my whole life, too
       F  G     Am   
'Cause I can't help

Falling in love with you

'Cause I can't help
 F          C    G    C
Falling in love with you
