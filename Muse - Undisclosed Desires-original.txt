Muse - Undisclosed Desires

Intro 2x: Cm Gm 

Riff: (Quando o vocalista começa a cantar)

 D#
 I know you've suffered
       Gm
 But I don't want you to hide
 D#
 It's cold and loveless
         Gm
 I won't let you be denied

 D#
 Soothing
      Gm
 I'll make you feel pure
 D#
 Trust me
 Gm
 You can be sure

(Refrão)

Cm         D#            Gm               A#
 I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
Cm         D#             Gm                  A#
 I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
Cm         D#           Gm               A#
 I want to exorcise the demons from your past
Cm         D#          Gm            A#            D#
 I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

 You trick your lovers
             Gm
 That you're wicked and divine
 D#
 You may be a sinner
          Gm
 But your innocence is mine
 D#
 Please me
 Gm
 Show me how it's done
 D#
 Tease me
 Gm
 You are the one
