Elton John - Tiny Dancer

[Intro]

[Primera Parte]

C         F     C     F     C                   Am   
Blue jean baby,  L.A. lady,  seamstress for the band
   G

C      F     C      F      C                    Am   
Pretty eyed, pirate smile,  you'll marry a music man
   G

F      Em  Am             D7    F  E7           Am    G
Ballerina,  you must've seen her,   dancing in the sand
C         F     C        F       C                   
Now she's in me,  always with me,  tiny dancer in my 
G  F Em Dm
hand

( C  F/C  C  F/C )

C     F       C           F      C                   
Jesus freaks,  out in the street,  handing tickets 
      Am       G
out for God
C       F     C         F       C                    
Turning back,  she just laughs,  the boulevard is not
      Am       G
 that bad
F     Em   Am              D7 F       E7    Am   G
Piano man,  he makes his stand,  in the auditorium
C       F   C              F      C                  
Looking on,  she sings the songs,  the words she 
                G  F Em Dm
knows, the tune she hums

( C  F/C  C  Dm/C  C )

Ab              Bb
  But oh how it feels so real
Gm               Cm
Lying here, with no one near
       Ab                    Bb
Where only you, and you can hear me
              Bº     Dº
When I say: "softly, slowly"

[Chorus]

F         C           Dm          Em
"Hold me closer Tiny Dancer"
F          C                  G
"Count the headlights on the highway"
F         C           Dm          Em
"Lay me down in sheets of linen"
F          C      G4
"You had a busy day today"

F         C           Dm          Em
"Hold me closer Tiny Dancer"
F          C                  G
"Count the headlights on the highway"
F         C           Dm          Em
"Lay me down in sheets of linen"
F          C      G4
"You had a busy day today"
