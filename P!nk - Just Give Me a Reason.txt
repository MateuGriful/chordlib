        C  Bm  Am

[Primera Part]

 G
Right from the start
             C                 Em
You were a thief you stole my heart
    C                  G
And I your willing victim
                                           C             Em
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         C                       G
And with every touch you fixed them

[Pre-Estribillo]

     Em                 A         D
Now you've been talking in your sleep oh oh
  Em              A      D
Things you never say to me oh oh
 Em                  A    D
Tell me that you've had enough
G/B     C   G/B  D7  D
Of our love our love

[Estribillo]

 G                            D
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
        Em                           Bm
Just a second we're not broken just bent
            D
And we can learn to love again
G                                D                          Em
  It's in the stars  it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken just bent
            D              G
And we can learn to love again

[Segona Part]

                                  C                       Em
Im sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
    C                   G
I thought that we were fine

(Oh we had everything)
                                    C                 Em
Your head is running wild again my dear we still have everything
    C                G
And its all in your mind

(Yeah but this is happening)

[Pre-Estribillo]

 Em                 A         D
You've been having real bad dreams oh oh
    Em               A       D
You used to lie so close to me oh oh
         Em            A          D
There's nothing more than empty sheets
    G/B      C   G/B  Am     C    G/B      D7 
Between our love our love oh our love our love

[Estribillo]

 G                            D
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
        Em                           Bm
Just a second we're not broken just bent
            D
And we can learn to love again
G                                D                          Em
  It's in the stars  it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken just bent
            D              Em
And we can learn to love again

[Puente]

                    Bm
Oh tears ducts and rust
                C
I'll fix it for us
                  D
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
Em                   Bm
   You're holding it in you're pouring a drink
C                   Am    D     
  No nothing is as bad as it seems

We'll come clean

[Estribillo]

Just give me a reason

Just a little bit's enough

Just a second we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars

It's been written in the scars on our hearts

We're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again
